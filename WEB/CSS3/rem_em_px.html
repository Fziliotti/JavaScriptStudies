      What is the difference between em and rem units? <br />
      Answer<br />
      Both em and rem units are based on the font-size CSS property. The only
      difference is where they inherit their values from.<br />

      em units inherit their value from the font-size of the parent element<br />
      rem units inherit their value from the font-size of the root element
      (html)<br />
      In most browsers, the font-size of the root element is set to 16px by
      default.<br />
