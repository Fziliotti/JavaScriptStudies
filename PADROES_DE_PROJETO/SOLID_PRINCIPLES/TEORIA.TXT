Object-Oriented type of programming brought a new design to software development.

This enables developers to combine data with the same purpose/functionality in one class to deal with the sole purpose there, regardless of the entire application.

But, this Object-oriented programming doesnâ€™t prevent confusing or unmaintainable programs.

As such, five guidelines were developed by Robert C. Martin. These five guidelines/principles made it easy for developers to create readable and maintainable programs.

These five principles were called the S.O.L.I.D principles (the acronym was derived by Michael Feathers).

S: Single Responsibility Principle
O: Open-Closed Principle
L: Liskov Substitution Principle
I: Interface Segregation Principle
D: Dependency Inversion Principle
