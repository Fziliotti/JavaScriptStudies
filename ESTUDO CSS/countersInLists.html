  <!-- You can create a ordered list using any type of HTML.

counter-reset Initializes a counter, the value is the name of the counter. By default, the counter starts at 0. This property can also be used to change its value to any specific number.

counter-increment Used in element that will be countable. Once counter-reset initialized, a counter's value can be increased or decreased.

counter(name, style) Displays the value of a section counter. Generally used in a content property. This function can receive two parameters, the first as the name of the counter and the second one can be decimal or upper-roman (decimal by default).

counters(counter, string, style) Displays the value of a section counter. Generally used in a content property. This function can receive three parameters, the first as the name of the counter, the second one you can include a string which comes after the counter and the third one can be decimal or upper-roman (decimal by default).

A CSS counter can be especially useful for making outlined lists, because a new instance of the counter is automatically created in child elements. Using the counters() function, separating text can be inserted between different levels of nested counters. -->
