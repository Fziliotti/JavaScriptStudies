What is the difference between an expression and a statement in JavaScript?
Answer
There are two main syntactic categories in JavaScript: expressions and statements. A third one is both together, referred to as an expression statement. They are roughly summarized as:

Expression: produces a value
Statement: performs an action
Expression statement: produces a value and performs an action



Statements
let x = 0

function declaration() {}

if (true) {
}
Statements appear as instructions that do something but don't produce values.

// Assign `x` to the absolute value of `y`.
var x
if (y >= 0) {
  x = y
} else {
  x = -y
}
The only expression in the above code is y >= 0 which produces a value, either true or false. A value is not produced by other parts of the code.

Expressions
Expressions produce a value. They can be passed around to functions because the interpreter replaces them with the value they resolve to.

5 + 5 // => 10

lastCharacter("input") // => "t"

true === true // => true
Expression statements
There is an equivalent version of the set of statements used before as an expression using the conditional operator:

// Assign `x` as the absolute value of `y`.
var x = y >= 0 ? y : -y
