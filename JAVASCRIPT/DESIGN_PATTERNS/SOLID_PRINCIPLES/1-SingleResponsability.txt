// A class should have only one job.

class Animal {
    constructor(name: string){ }
    getAnimalName() { }
    saveAnimal(a: Animal) { }
}

SRP states that classes should have one responsibility, here, we can draw out two responsibilities: animal database management and animal properties management. The constructor and getAnimalName manage the Animal properties while the saveAnimal manages the Animal storage on a database.


RESOLUTION:

To make this conform to SRP, we create another class that will handle the sole responsibility of storing an animal to a database:

class Animal {
    constructor(name: string){ }
    getAnimalName() { }
}
class AnimalDB {
    getAnimal(a: Animal) { }
    saveAnimal(a: Animal) { }
}
